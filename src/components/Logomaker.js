    Any consumer who wants to explore & design logomakes can begin with
    selecting/outlining a company name followed by picking fonts & case. The
    next step for creating the perfect trademark is connecting symbolic shades &
    colors to it. Move further by determining & specifying meaningful icons for
    a pleasing layout.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Our high tech team of designers & developers have collaborated to fabricate
    the flawless logomakes. With frontend technology like Vue.JS, HTML & CSS-
    the project was set up & completed with precision & fruitful results. Apart
    from the basic technologies & coding, a very special part & copart of this
    project is contributed by an inbuilt canvas library called Fabric.JS. A
    powerful & simple library to build SVGs. With an easy yet robust tech stack,
    Labs.decabits delivered its very first open source tool for going live.
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    A noteworthy detail & feature makes its free download service of the logos,
    in all formats like PNG, JPEG & SVG (With or without background)
  </p>
  <p class="content">
    Any logo the consumer may create will directly be saved in the galleries,
    even if you are halfway through. Once you want to get back to the design,
    with a single click the consumer will be redirected to an editable file for
    making the needful alterations.
